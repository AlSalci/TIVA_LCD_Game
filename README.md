This code implements a game that can be played on the Tiva C Series TM4C123G microcontroller. The game is displayed on an LCD, with the controls being 3 push buttons. When the game starts, the player as well as several
enemies will spawn on the LCD. The push buttons will move the player between the lines and columns of the LCD, while the enemies will move randomly around the screen. As time goes on, the game speed will progressively 
increase as to give the player more challenge. If the player and an enemy share the same location on the LCD, the game will end and the players score will be shown to them. 
The score is calculated based on how long the player is able to avoid the enemies.
